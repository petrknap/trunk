## What is Migration?

> **Data migration** is the process of transferring data between storage types, formats, or computer systems. It is a key consideration for any system implementation, upgrade, or consolidation. Data migration is usually **performed programmatically to achieve an automated migration**, freeing up human resources from tedious tasks. Data migration occurs for a variety of reasons, including server or storage equipment replacements, maintenance or upgrades, application migration, website consolidation and data center relocation.

## Usage of php-migrationtool

### Migration files

Migration file is file placed in special directory like `/migrations`. Migration file name contains 3 parts: *migration id*, *description* separated by space (optional) and *extension* separated by dot (optional) - the valid names for migration files are `{id}`, `{id}.{extension}`, `{id} {description}` and `{id} {description}.{extension}`.

```
user@localhost:~/project/migrations$ ls
M0001  M0002.ext  M0003 - Third migration  M0004 - Fourth migration.ext
```

Migration tools process **all files located in directory in ascending order** (sorted by file names). If applying of any migration file throws exception, the changes invoked by this file will be canceled and migration tool will be stopped.

Migration tools also contain lists of applied migrations and guarantee that every file will be processed only once and only in case that there is not applied migration with higher id.

### Migration tools

All migration tools implement `MigrationToolInterface` with method `migrate()`.

```php
$tool = new MigrationTool();
$tool->migrate();
```

#### SQL migration tool

**WARNING:** The SQL migration tool processes only files with extension `sql`.

```php
class SqlMigrationTool extends PetrKnap\Php\MigrationTool\SqlMigrationTool
{
    protected function getPhpDataObject()
    {
        return new PDO("sqlite::memory:");
    }

    protected function getNameOfMigrationTable()
    {
        return "migrations";
    }

    protected function getPathToDirectoryWithMigrationFiles()
    {
        return __DIR__ . "/migrations";
    }
}
```

SQL migration tool **supports native SQL files** as migration file. You can simply copy and paste output from [orm:schema-tool:update --dump-sql], [phpMyAdmin], [Adminer] or whatever with SQL output to SQL file.
