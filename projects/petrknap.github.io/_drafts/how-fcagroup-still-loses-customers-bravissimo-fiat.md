As you know from [my first article about my factory new Fiat Tipo](/notes/2017/12/03/how-fca-group-lost-customer-in-six-months-bravissimo-fiat.html) there **was approved 2 of 3 complaints** to be rapaired.
You also know, that there was a problem with a dealer, with a customer care and **now there is a problem with authorized service too**.
*Hurrah!* 

![The last time I have seen my car](/notes/data/fiat-tipo/good-bye.jpg)

Now it’s about half of February 2018 (complaint submitted in October 2017), the **deadline for repair is gone** and they simply don’t contact me.
So I take my phone and call them to get information that **they need more time to finish the repairs**. 

> Ode dne uplatnění reklamace má prodejce maximálně 30 kalendářních dní na vyřízení, měl by se však snažit reklamaci vyřídit bez zbytečného odkladu.
> Rozhodnout o ní prodejce podle zákona musí ihned, ve složitých případech do 3 pracovních dnů.

By law **they have 3 days to approve and 30 days from submitting complaint to finish the repairs**, but it took 31 days to only approve it.
Now **it’s more than 90 days and they need more time**.

> Bravissimo!
