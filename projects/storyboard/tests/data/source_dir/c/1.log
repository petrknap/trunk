* <Robert> comes to school
<Robert> Good afternoon, teacher, how are you today?
<Teacher> Good afternoon, Robert. I am doing well. And you?
<Robert> I’m great, thank you. This is my best friend Jane. She  wants to apply to come to this university. She would like to ask you a few questions. Would you mind taking the time and telling her what process she would have to do, please?
